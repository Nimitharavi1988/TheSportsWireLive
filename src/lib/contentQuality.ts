// the admin bulk-approve actions had no quality check at all and published
// 310 articles in one shot, many well under the bar enforced everywhere
// else. Every path that can make an article live -- the automated
// auto-approve cron, admin bulk-approve, admin approve-all, and (as a

// gives real room for actual substance without being so strict that a
// genuinely short-but-real story (a brief injury update, a single
