/**
 * Provider-independent match identity (Article.matchKey):
 *   `${category}:${yyyy-mm-dd}:${home}-v-${away}`
 * e.g. "american-football:2026-09-27:buffalo-bills-v-los-angeles-chargers".
 *
 * dedupeHash stays provider-specific (built from e.g. "espn-nfl-<id>"), which
 * is right for "have I seen this exact provider record", but means a second
 * provider for the same game would look like a brand-new match. matchKey is
 * what two providers agree on, so one can be compared against or swapped in
 * for the other without duplicating the match.
 *
 * Date is the kickoff's UTC calendar day. Team names are slugified here, not
 * resolved to canonical names — providers that spell a team differently
 * ("LA Chargers" vs "Los Angeles Chargers") need an alias pass before
 * comparing; that belongs with the provider adapter that introduces it.
