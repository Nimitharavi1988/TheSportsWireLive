/**
 * Pulls NFL match data from ESPN's public scoreboard/standings JSON API
 * (site.api.espn.com). Unofficial and undocumented — ESPN doesn't publish
 * or support it, so it could change or get rate-limited without notice —
 * but no API key is required, confirmed working directly (2026-09-10), and
 * this exact endpoint shape has been stable and widely used by developers
 * for years (unlike, for example, Reddit's recently-locked-down endpoint).
 *
 * Same RawMatchItem shape as footballData.ts, reused directly rather than
 * duplicated.
