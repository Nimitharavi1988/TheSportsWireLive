Facts from the source report (for reference only — do not copy any phrase or sentence from this text):
"""
${sourceSnippet}
"""

Write a fuller original blurb (aim for 2 short paragraphs, roughly 5-8 sentences total when the facts support it) covering every concrete fact given above — names, numbers, results, context — in your own words and sentence structure. Rules:
- Never copy phrasing verbatim or near-verbatim from the facts above — use entirely your own wording and sentence structure throughout.
- Never invent any fact, statistic, quote, or detail not present in the facts above. Do not pad length with generic filler, speculation, or restating the same fact twice — only expand as far as the real facts given actually go.
- If the facts above are too thin to fill that length without inventing or repeating, write a shorter piece instead — brevity is always better than padding.
- If the facts above contain no real, substantive, reportable information at all — no actual score, statement, decision, or specific development, just a bare name/place/headline restated — do not paper over that gap with vague hedge sentences ("X has been highlighted in recent coverage", "no further details were provided"), vague hype language that sounds exciting but conveys nothing concrete ("action is underway", "immediate fireworks", "explosive start", "set an early tone", "off to a flying start"), OR self-referential sentences that describe the existence of coverage instead of the actual event ("MLB.com has published an analytical breakdown of Gerrit Cole's pitching arsenal", "The feature examines the mechanics behind the blast", "This analysis centers on..."). That last pattern is especially common when the source is a short video-clip title (e.g. "Breaking down X's pitches", "Field View: Y homers") with no real substance behind the headline — describing that a breakdown/analysis/feature exists is not the same as reporting a fact, even though it reads grammatically like a real sentence. A reader must learn at least one real, specific, checkable fact from every sentence you write — if you can't do that because the facts above genuinely don't contain one, return an empty commentary instead. An honest empty result is always better than a sentence that merely sounds like news.
- Separate paragraphs with a literal blank line (two newlines) — never return the whole thing as one unbroken block.
- Do not mention that you were given source material or instructions — just write the blurb itself.
- Plain text only, no markdown.

Also list the real, named individuals (athletes, coaches, or officials) this story is centrally about — not team names, and not any journalist, reporter, or pundit merely cited as the source of the report. Order them by prominence to the story (most central first), fullest real name as it would appear as a Wikipedia article title (e.g. "Ben Stokes", not "Stokes" or "the England captain"). Include more than one only when multiple people are genuinely co-central (e.g. a batter and a bowler both credited for a result) — don't pad the list with minor mentions. If no specific named athlete/coach/official is truly central, leave personNames empty.

Also extract the real-world venue/stadium name (e.g. "Old Trafford", "Lord's", "the MCG") ONLY if the facts above genuinely state where this happened — never guess, infer from the teams/competition, or fill in a team's usual home ground. If no venue is explicitly stated in the facts, leave venue empty.`;

- Do not include any hashtags — those are added separately.
- Do not repeat the headline verbatim at the top.
- If the story is built around something a named player, coach or pundit said, lead with their exact words in quotation marks, attributed by name. Only use a quote that appears word for word in the facts; never paraphrase inside quotation marks.

INSTAGRAM caption:
- Longer than the Facebook version. Instagram cuts the caption off after roughly the first 100 characters behind a "...more" button, so the FIRST LINE must stand alone, be under 100 characters, and make someone want to tap: lead with the most surprising or consequential real fact (a name, number or result) or the tension in the story, not scene-setting and not the team's name alone.
- If the story is built around something a named player, coach or pundit said, the first line may be their exact words in quotation marks with their name (e.g. Gambhir: "this is not cricket"). Only a quote that appears word for word in the facts; never paraphrase inside quotation marks.
- Then 2-3 short paragraphs of real detail from the facts, with 1-3 emojis as visual breaks (not decorative clutter — each one should mark a real break in the text).
- Second to last line: one genuine engagement question or pick-a-side prompt that people can answer in a comment in a few words (e.g. "Who takes it?", "Fair call or not?"). It must be about something the facts actually raise, never generic ("What do you think?") and never a claim.
- Last line: a short note that the full story is linked in the bio (your own wording).
- Do not include any hashtags — those are added separately.
- Do not repeat the headline verbatim at the top.

Both captions must stay strictly true to the facts given above — no invented details, no speculation stated as fact. Emotion words must match the facts: use the source's own verb ("slams", "criticises") and never a stronger one ("furious", "outraged") unless the text says so. Plain text only, no markdown.`;

Lead with the single most surprising or consequential real fact (a specific name, number or result), then add stakes or tension when the text supports it: what it means, what's now on the line, the unexpected part, or a clear question the story answers. Prefer a concrete claim to a label. If the story is built around what a named person said, the hook may be their exact words (short, attributed, e.g. Gambhir: "not cricket"), only a quote that appears word for word in the article. Good: "Salah scores 3 in 20 minutes", "Eagles lose Hurts for the season?" (only if the text says so), "296 chased with 8 overs to spare". Bad: "A stunning night at Anfield", "Big news in the NFL", "You won't believe this". A curiosity gap is fine only when the answer is actually in the article; never state or imply anything the text doesn't support, and never imply a twist that didn't happen. Emotion words must match the source: use the article's own verb or a direct quote ("slams", "blasts", "admits") rather than a stronger one (not "furious", "outraged", "destroyed" unless the text says so). Punchy and accurate beats louder.

Fewer, real rows are better than padding with invented or vague ones. Order rows most important first.
- Every row must be about the headline's own story: the same game, teams and people. Articles often end with other results, a roundup of other games, or related links; never take a row from those parts, even if the numbers look impressive. Don't repeat the hook in a row.
- Every row must ADD something a reader can't already see in the headline and hook: a number, a score, a stat, a record, a name not yet mentioned, a quote, a date, or what happens next. A row that just restates who or what the headline already names ("Player: Jalen Hurts", "Team: Philadelphia Eagles" under a headline about them) is wrong. Prefer concrete facts like "296 runs chased with 8 overs to spare" over labels. If fewer than 3 rows add something new, return fewer rows.
