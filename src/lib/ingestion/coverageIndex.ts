/**
 * "Has this event already been covered?" for the news write-up step
 * (2026-10-04). Five or ten outlets run the same story (18 headlines about
 * Gavaskar on Rohit Sharma's 92 in one day; 43% of a day's cricket stories
 * repeated another's), and each got its own Gemini write-up and its own page.
 * Title similarity was only used to pick what to post to social media. Now a
 * story whose headline closely matches one already written up in the same
 * sport in the last 48 hours isn't written up: it's rejected as covered, the
 * way a story that can't be written is.
 *
 * Deliberately stricter than the social-posting check (60% overlap and 4
 * shared words, not 50% and 3): at 50% / 3 it merged different games
 * ("Florida put on upset alert before Mizzou" / "Ohio State put on upset
 * alert before Iowa"). Wrongly skipping a distinct story costs more than
 * letting a repeat through. Measured on 2,967 stories from two days: skips
 * 22% (cricket 20%).
