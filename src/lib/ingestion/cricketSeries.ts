/**
 * Groups cricket articles — both structured match-data items (CricketData.org)
 * AND editorial RSS/player-news coverage — into a shared "series" whenever
 * they're about the same bilateral international tour (e.g. "India vs
 * Afghanistan, T20I"), so /series/[seriesKey] can list a tour's news together
 * instead of the site only ever showing one flat chronological feed.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped to bilateral INTERNATIONAL series only (Test/ODI/T20I)
 * for now, not franchise tournaments (IPL etc.) — those group by a single
 * tournament name rather than a team pair, a different shape this doesn't
 * attempt to handle yet.
 *
 * NOT gated on cricketCountries.ts's CRICKET_COUNTRIES list — Afghanistan and
 * West Indies are deliberately excluded there (no freely-licensed flag /
 * no single national flag), but both are entirely real, common international
 * teams that need to group correctly here regardless.
 *
 * Detection is title-only (detectSeriesFromTitle), NOT anchored to
 * CricketData.org match data — an earlier version required a live match from
 * that feed to "seed" a series before any editorial article could be tagged.
 * Confirmed live that this was a real design flaw, not a temporary gap: a
 * genuine, heavily-covered England vs Pakistan Test (day four, BBC/Cricinfo/
 * Guardian all over it) never appeared in CricketData.org's currentMatches at
 * all — that free-tier feed reliably surfaces domestic franchise/county
 * cricket but not every real international. Two recognized team names (see
 * TEAM_NAMES below) plus a format word in the SAME title is a safe signal on
 * its own: country names aren't ambiguous the way player surnames can be, and
 * every ingested item is already recency-filtered (MAX_RSS_ITEM_AGE_MS, 3
 * days), so a title-only match is overwhelmingly about a current series, not
 * an old one being retrospectively discussed.
