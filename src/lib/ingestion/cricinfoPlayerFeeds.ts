/**
 * ESPN Cricinfo publishes a dedicated RSS feed per player — confirmed live
 * (2026-09-12): https://www.cricinfo.com/rss/content/story/feeds/{id}.xml
 * returns real headlines, a real description (genuine editorial content,
 * not a repeated headline — unlike Google News' per-player search, see
 * playerNewsFeeds.ts), and a direct cricinfo.com article URL (no redirect
 * page to resolve). Same officially-syndicated feed family as the country
 * feeds already used in rssFeeds.ts (feeds/0.xml, feeds/6.xml).
 *
 * This is the primary source for tracked cricket players going forward —
 * Google News search (playerNewsFeeds.ts) stays in place as a
 * breadth-of-coverage fallback for players/stories Cricinfo doesn't carry,
 * but its links can't be resolved to real article text (Google's redirect
 * requires client-side JS), so it can never produce a real body the way
 * this feed can.
