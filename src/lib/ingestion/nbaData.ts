/**
 * Pulls NBA match data from ESPN's public scoreboard JSON API
 * (site.api.espn.com) — same unofficial/undocumented endpoint family as
 * nflData.ts, confirmed working directly (2026-09-12): real event/team/
 * score/logo fields, identical shape to the NFL endpoint.
 *
 * Standings table added 2026-09-20 (real gap found: the homepage sidebar
 * had no standings widget at all for `?category=basketball`, unlike
 * football/NFL) — same `site.api.espn.com/apis/v2/sports/.../standings`
 * endpoint family and same stat names (wins/losses/playoffSeed) as NFL's,
 * confirmed live.
 *
 * Same RawMatchItem shape as footballData.ts/nflData.ts, reused directly.
