/**
 * Pulls US college volleyball match data from ESPN's public scoreboard API
 * (site.api.espn.com) — same unofficial-but-keyless pattern as
 * nhlData.ts/domesticFootballData.ts. Added as a second volleyball source
 * alongside volleyballData.ts (API-Sports.io, international/pro
 * competitions) after that account was suspended — confirmed live
 * (2026-09-16) this endpoint has no such dependency, plus richer data than
 * API-Sports ever provided: real venue, per-set scores, and season
 * win-loss records, all used below instead of the bare one-liner
 * volleyballData.ts was limited to.
 *
 * Scope is narrower than the API-Sports source (US college only, not
 * international/national-team competitions) — a real gap, not a full
 * replacement, but genuinely free and reliable where it applies.
 *
 * Same RawMatchItem shape as footballData.ts, reused directly.
