/**
 * Pulls match data for major domestic football leagues that our existing

 * BBC/Sky/ESPN's RSS feeds (rssFeeds.ts) skew heavily toward the Premier
 * League, leaving Bundesliga/Serie A/Ligue 1/MLS with almost no coverage
 * despite real audience reach.
 *
 * Same ESPN public scoreboard API as nflData.ts/mlbData.ts/nbaData.ts
 * (site.api.espn.com) — unofficial and undocumented, but no API key
 * required and confirmed working live (2026-09-16), including real venue
 * data (ESPN provides this for these leagues, unlike football-data.org on
 * our tier — see footballData.ts's RawMatchItem.venue comment).
 *
 * Same RawMatchItem shape as footballData.ts, reused directly.
