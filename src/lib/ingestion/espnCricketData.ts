/**
 * Cricket from ESPN (Cricinfo's scoreboard, free, no key): every match in
 * progress or about to start across international and domestic cricket,
 * with live scores. Added 2026-09-26 because the free CricketData tier
 * returned only English county matches for days — no internationals (e.g.
 * the Asian Games) at all. CricketData stays; where both have the same
 * match, the first to store it owns it (runIngest.ts, via matchKey), so no
 * match shows twice.
 *
 * Source: site.api.espn.com/apis/personalized/v2/scoreboard/header
 * ?sport=cricket — current events grouped by league. Shape checked live
 * 2026-09-26: event.status "pre"|"in"|"post", fullStatus.{longSummary,
 * dayNumber}, competitors[].{homeAway, displayName, score, logo}.
