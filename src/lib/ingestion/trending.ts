/**
 * Pulls today's Google Trends daily trending searches and uses them, plus
 * two other signals, to score already-ingested articles for ranking:
 *  - Google Trends search volume (this file) — what people are searching.
 *  - Reddit hot-post engagement (redditEngagement.ts) — what people are
 *    actually discussing right now, a real engagement signal Trends alone
 *    misses.
 *  - Event-type/superstar keyword heuristics (eventKeywords.ts,
 *    players.ts) — catches high-interest story types (transfers, records,
 *    deaths) and superstar-player stories that neither of the above
 *    reliably catches on their own.
 * Higher trendingScore surfaces an article first on the homepage and gets
 * it priority for the limited Gemini commentary budget during ingestion.
 *
 * Uses an unofficial Google Trends client (no official public API exists
 * yet). Treat this as best-effort: if Google changes something and this
 * breaks, ingestion should keep working without it (everything just gets
 * a lower trendingScore, same as before — the other two signals still
 * apply).

// BBC/Sky/Guardian — most of this site's RSS sources — are UK outlets, so
// US-only search trends were a real mismatch for a lot of the content.
// India added 2026-09-20 (explicit request) — cricket's real audience
// skews India/Asia (Cricinfo India feed, Hindustan Times, the ongoing
// India promotions push), but this signal previously had zero India
// coverage despite being the single highest-weighted signal in
// computeTrendingScore (+10 per match).
// Ireland and Sweden added same day (explicit request) — this site's
// confirmed real secondary audience, and this signal is shared across every
// article regardless of category (not cricket-specific), so it benefits
// every sport equally. Confirmed live: Sweden's own daily trends already
// include "shl tabell" (Swedish Hockey League standings) — real overlap
// with hockey, one of the categories boosted in computeTrendingScore's
// audience-match bonus. UK is already covered via "GB"; Australia
// deliberately left out — real, live trending data exists for it too, but
// it wasn't part of the confirmed real audience breakdown, so adding it
// would be a guess rather than a data-backed choice.
// All geos are queried and merged independently — one failing never drops
// the others' results.
