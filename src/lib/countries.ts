/**
 * Tracked cricket-playing nations for /country/[slug] pages — same
 * curated-list-plus-substring-searchTerms pattern as clubs.ts/players.ts.
 * Sourced from the same 14-nation list already established in
 * social/facebook.ts's TEAM_TO_CODE (used there for matchup hashtags), kept
 * consistent rather than inventing a second "core cricket nations" list.
 *
 * Cricket-only for now — country pages read as a general "all our coverage
 * of this nation" feed (not sport-scoped, same as club/player pages don't
 * scope either), so a football fan's mention of "England" or "Australia"
 * still gets linked and shown here too; it's just that the country list
 * itself was chosen for cricket relevance. Extend if a real gap turns up
 * for a nation prominent in another sport but missing here.
