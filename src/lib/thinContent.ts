/**
 * Which ingested stories are offered to search engines (2026-10-04).
 *
 * An ingested story is a short write-up of another outlet's report. A
 * database count that day: 19,876 published, 19,872 of them under 300 words
 * (the longest 347). At that volume, pages like these can count against how
 * the whole site is judged: they were the likely reason AdSense turned the
 * site down. So they stay up for readers and social posts, but are noindex
 * and left out of the sitemaps, the same treatment match score cards already
 * get. Fan threads, live streams and "how to watch" items are left out
 * whatever their length.
 *
 * Original stories (written in admin) are always indexed. One that becomes a
 * substantial piece (300+ words) is indexed again automatically.
 *
 * isThinRewrite (pages) and indexableArticleSql (sitemaps) must agree, so
 * both count words the same way: the body (or the summary when there is no
 * body), trimmed, split on runs of whitespace.
