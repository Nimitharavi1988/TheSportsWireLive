// Catches "same real-world event, different publisher's headline" — the
// exact-normalized-title dedupe in dedupe.ts only blocks a byte-identical
// headline, so 3-4 outlets covering the same match/moment each get ingested
// as a genuinely separate article (different wording), and each was then
// independently eligible to post to Facebook/Instagram. Confirmed live
// 2026-09-20: 4 different sources' "Salah hat-trick vs Galatasaray" articles
// each posted to the Page within ~8 hours.
//
// This is a word-overlap heuristic, not true semantic similarity — it won't
// catch every near-duplicate (a differently-angled piece on the same event,
// e.g. "Why Salah made history", shares few literal words with a plain match
// recap), but it catches the common case (most real duplicate coverage
// reuses the same names/score/opponent) with no added API cost or latency
// on every post attempt.

// Overlap coefficient (intersection / smaller set size) rather than

// MIN_ABSOLUTE_OVERLAP guards a real structural flaw in the ratio alone,
// found live 2026-09-20 (hours after this shipped): a bare match-result
// template ("Colorado Rockies 4-5 Seattle Mariners") has only 3-4
// significant words total, so sharing just 2 of them — the team names —
// with ANY other headline mentioning either team that day (extremely
// common) already clears 0.5 on a 4-word title. Confirmed live: this
// blocked every one of 96 fresh Facebook-posting candidates in one run, a
// full posting stall. The ratio alone can't distinguish "these titles are
// about the same real event" from "these titles are both short and happen
// to share one proper noun" once titles get this small — an absolute
// floor is required regardless of source or title length, not just a
// ratio, since the failure mode is short titles in general, not any one
// category of them.
