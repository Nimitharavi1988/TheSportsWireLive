/**
 * Live research and fact-check for the automatic drafts (autoDraft.ts).
 *
 * The site's own data (draftFacts.ts) is fixtures and our ingested stories,
 * and the ingested stories carry the original publishers' mistakes: an
 * auto-draft about Prasidh Krishna's "injury setback" (2026-10-02) rested on
 * a claim no outside report backed. So before writing, Gemini searches the
 * web (Google Search grounding) for the story's facts; after writing, a
 * second call checks every sentence against those facts and drops what they
 * don't support.
 *
 * Grounding can't be combined with a JSON response schema in one call, so the
 * research call answers in plain "FACT:" lines (parsed here), and the check
 * is an ordinary structured call (callGemini).
