"""
${s.text}
"""

Verified facts from today's reporting (the ONLY facts you may state):
${s.facts.map((f) => `- ${f}`).join("\n")}

Rules:
- A news report, not an opinion piece: open with the most important facts, then the details and the context (results, standings, records, what led here), all from the facts above. Say what happens next ONLY if a fact names it (a date, an opponent, a decision); otherwise end on the last real fact.
- No filler: never write general outlook or commentary such as "both teams will need to...", "remains to be seen", "will test whether" or "a catalyst for improvement", and never call a team's form a "surge", "run" or "streak" unless a fact states it. Use more of the facts instead (standings, records, individual numbers, quotes).
- Never invent anything: no names, numbers, quotes, dates or events that aren't in the facts. Quotes only word for word as given, with who said them.
- Say which team or side a person belongs to only where a fact says so; never work it out yourself, and never describe how a game "turned" or who "had momentum" beyond what the facts state.
- Your own words throughout; don't copy sentences from the facts or the short version.
- 350-550 words if the facts support it; never pad with filler or repeat a point.
- Never talk about your inputs or what is missing: no "the facts", "provided", "verified", "the report concludes", "no further details are provided". If something is not known, leave it out silently. No speculation about what might happen (no "could", "pending clearances", "ready for the second half").
- Plain paragraphs only: no subheadings, bullet points, bold or emojis. Don't mention the sources, the research or these instructions.`;
